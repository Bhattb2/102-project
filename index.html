<h2>About Uganda</h2>
    <p>
    Uganda, is a country in East-Central Africa. It is                 bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South               Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the               Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by            Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a              substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya            and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes                 region. Uganda also lies within the Nile basin, and has            a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate.<br>
    <br>
    “The Pearl of Africa” is synonymous with Uganda.                   Winston Churchill dubbed Uganda “The Pearl of Africa” in           1907 while just a young Member of Parliament, saying:
    <br>
    “The kingdom of Uganda is a fairy-tale. You climb up … and         at the end there is a wonderful new world. The scenery is          different, the vegetation is different, the climate is             different, and, most of all, the people are different from         anything elsewhere to be seen in the whole range of Africa         … I say: ‘Concentrate on Uganda’. For magnificence, for            variety of form and colour, for profusion of brilliant life         – bird, insect, reptile, beast – for vast scale — Uganda is         truly the pearl of Africa.” <br>

    Murchison Falls Conservation Area ( MFCA ) comprises               of Murchison Falls National Park, Bugungu and Karuma               Falls Wildlife Reserves. This is where the Nile                    explodes through a narrow gorge and cascades down to               become a placid river whose banks are thronged with                hippos and crocodiles, waterbucks and buffaloes. The               vegetation is characterised by savannah, riverine                  forest and woodland. Wildlife includes lions, leopards,            elephants, giraffes, hartebeests, oribis, Uganda kobs,             chimpanzees, and many bird species. The waters of the              Nile force their way through a small slit within the               rocks, which is just 7 meters or 23 feet wide, and                 topples to 43 meters or 141 feet below with a thunderous           roar forming a residual water stray that forms a                   beautiful rainbow; the view is very breathtaking! <br>

    Queen Elizabeth National Park is understandably Uganda’s           most popular tourist destination. The park’s diverse               ecosystems, which include sprawling savanna, shady, humid          forests, sparkling lakes and fertile wetlands, make it the         ideal habitat for classic big game, ten primate species            including chimpanzees and over 600 species of birds.

    Set against the backdrop of the jagged Rwenzori Mountains,         the park’s magnificent vistas include dozens of enormous           craters carved dramatically into rolling green hills,              panoramic views of the Kazinga Channel with its banks              lined with  hippos, buffalo and elephants, and the endless         Ishasha plains, whose fig trees hide lions ready to pounce         on herds of unsuspecting Uganda ko

    <p>
    Like the mountains, Uganda has plenty of lakes formed in a         volcanic crater or caldera. The ones in dormant volcanoes          like Lake Kyaninga in Fort Portal in western Uganda have           fresh waters. A swim in the Crater Lake in Kyaninga before         lunch at Kyaninga Lodge is something some ought to do while         in Uganda. The serenity of Lake Kyaninga is as inviting as         it’s ominous, with steep banks at most edges, she hides her         220 metre depth well. The swim across looks doable by the          average swimmer, with the constant foreboding that a               prehistoric monster will rise out of his murky depth and           make a quick lunch of one, adding to the excitement!
